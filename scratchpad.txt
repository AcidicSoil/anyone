# Project Scratchpad

## Phase 2: Project Structure Stubbed Out (COMPLETED)

Steps:
1. [X] Create bare minimum files:
   [X] globals.css with just Tailwind imports
   [X] Simple page.tsx with "Hello World"
   [X] Basic layout.tsx without any providers
2. [X] Remove unused imports
3. [X] Start development server
4. [X] Create core feature components:
   [X] Repository upload interface
   [X] Analysis progress tracking
   [X] Results dashboard
   [X] Integration guide
5. [X] Create layout components:
   [X] Header
   [X] Footer
   [X] Mode toggle
6. [X] Create data models:
   [X] Repository types
   [X] Analysis results types
   [X] Integration guide types
7. [X] Create service stubs:
   [X] Repository service
   [X] Integration service
   [X] Analysis engine
8. [X] Create page stubs:
   [X] Dashboard page
9. [X] Update README.md with project information

## Phase 3: Implementation (NEXT)

Steps:
1. [ ] Implement actual functionality for each component
2. [ ] Set up API endpoints for repository analysis
3. [ ] Implement the analysis engine
4. [ ] Add authentication and user management
5. [ ] Enhance UI with animations and transitions
6. [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
7. [ ] Implement testing

## Debug Checklist:
- [X] Remove unused component imports
- [ ] Verify page loads in browser
- [ ] Confirm no console errors
- [ ] Test Tailwind classes are working

## Design Guidelines:
- Use our established color palette
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Ensure responsive layout
- Follow accessibility guidelines

We are in design mode. We're focusing on rapid UI/UX prototyping and visual design.
We're using mock data and temporary solutions to quickly validate concepts and user flows.

We are prototyping with emphasis on:
Creating engaging user interfaces
Testing different visual layouts and components
Building interactive user flows and animations
Using dummy data and mock APIs
Implementing quick frontend features
Focusing on responsive design and accessibility
Exploring different design patterns
Creating reusable UI components
Testing user interactions and feedback
Rapid iteration based on feedback
This mode prioritizes speed, visual appeal, and user experience over backend implementation.
The key principles are:
Quick prototypes over complete implementations
Visual demos over production-ready code
Happy path flows over extensive error handling
Convenience over security constraints
Quick solutions over performance optimization


We are in logic mode. We're focusing on robust backend functionality and proper system architecture.
We're implementing real data flows, API integrations, and production-ready features.



Real implementation over prototypes
Production-ready code over quick demos
Proper error handling over happy paths
Security over convenience
Performance over quick solutions
Testing over assumptions
Documentation over implicit knowledge

We are building for production with emphasis on:
Implementing secure and scalable backend systems
Creating proper data models and database schemas
Writing comprehensive error handling and validation
Building reliable API integrations and services
Ensuring proper testing coverage and documentation
Optimizing performance and resource usage
Following best practices for maintainable code
Creating reusable and modular components
Implementing proper authentication and authorization
Setting up logging, monitoring, and error tracking
This mode prioritizes correctness, reliability, and maintainability over rapid visual iteration.
